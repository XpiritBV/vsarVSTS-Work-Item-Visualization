## Visualize work item relationships

[![Demo](images/wvizdemo.png)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Studio-ALM-Rangers-Demos/VS-Team-Services-Work-Item-Visualization-Extension) In Visual Studio Team Services you can add, edit and display work items in query results and various boards. With this extension you can visualize these work items from within the work item form.

### Drill-down in your chart and even visualize commits

You can visually see how work items relate to each other, as well as code, tests, test results, builds and external artifacts. Even drill into your commits to explore the changeset details.

### Highlight what's important
Use colors to highlight important work item types within your visualization.

### Focus on what's important
Use `Zoom In`, `Zoom Out`, `Zoom to original size` or `Fit To` toolbar icons to zoom in and out of your chart. Switch the orientation of your chart between `horizontal` and `vertical` view.

### Find on visualization

> **NEW** - *This is an early version with limited functionality. Please provide feedback.*

Previously the find on visualization allowed to enter and id and start visualization from it. Since we have visualization possible from all contexts now we deemed this unnecessary and thought it may be more useful to allow searching items on the visualization instead.
